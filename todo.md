    - Make sure the next grade threshold returns a (- score), not a (+ score).
    - Change the groove gauge graph lines so that the area above 80% (60% for Assist-Easy, or all red if Hard or EX-Hard) is red, and the area below 80% is green.
    - Allow pressing any 2/4/6 + 1/3/5/7 key combination to quickly restart the chart with the same Random seed (if any Random method is applied).
    - Add a fading animation for the results screen before returning to the song select screen wen a key is pressed. Make sure that keypresses during the fade-out animation are ignored until the song select screen is fully displayed.
