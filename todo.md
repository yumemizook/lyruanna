- Song select:
    - Change the keyboard-based navigation:
        - Key 1/3/5/7 or Enter starts the selected chart, or open the focused folder
        - Key 2/4/6 returns to the previous folder (going up in the directory)
        - Add up/down arrows for song navigation, and Escape to go up in the directory (or exit the game if in the folders display)
    - Correct the issues:
        - The selected chart is changed when closing the player options screen via mouse, and when returning from the results screen.
        - The music wheel should be seamlessly looping from one end to another, and the '..' folder shouldnt be in the song list.
    - Implement the Best score display: Grade, clear type, Rate%, EX Score/total, and date.
- Decide screen:
    - All keypresses should skip the screen (fade the screen out) and display the playfield immediately (except for the Escape key, which should return to the song select instead)
    - The keypresses should not navigate the folders/charts if the Decide screen is active.
- Gameplay:
    - Change the gauge% so that it is displayed with 1 decimal place (e.g. 99.9%). Then, change the visual gauge so that it increments every 2% gained, and display a small line indicator for each 2% gained, or staying on if the gauge is 100%.
    - Change the gauge color: Purple/Yellow for Assist Easy/Easy, Blue/Red for Normal(Groove), Red for Hard, Orange for EX-Hard, and White for Hazard (one combo break except for empty POORs immediately fails the chart)
    - Add a vertical song progress bar on the left of the notefield, scrolling from top to bottom, and has the same height as the notefield.
    - Add a proper failing screen with animations before fading out and displaying the results screen. Do the same fade-out animation if the player has finished a chart.
- Results screen:
    - Make sure the next grade threshold returns a (- score), not a (+ score).
    - Change the groove gauge graph lines so that the area above 80% (60% for Assist-Easy, or all red if Hard or EX-Hard) is red, and the area below 80% is green.
    - Allow pressing any 2/4/6 + 1/3/5/7 key combination to quickly restart the chart with the same Random seed (if any Random method is applied).
    - Add a fading animation for the results screen before returning to the song select screen. Make sure that keypresses during the fade-out animation are ignored until the song select screen is fully displayed.
